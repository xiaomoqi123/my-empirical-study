# Impact of datasets on machine learning based methodsin Android malware detection:  an empirical study

## Abstract: 
Context:For  Android  malware  detection,  machine  learning-based  methodsshow promising performance.  However, the factors related to datasets are lackof the investigation, while the performance of machine learning-based methodsdramatically relies on datasets.
Objective:This paper aims to investigate the impact of dataset factors on theperformance of machine learning-based methods in Android malware detection.
Method:In this paper,  we first investigate dataset differences between real-world scenarios and existing machine learning-based methods from four factors,including the timelines of datasets,  combinations of malicious and benign ap-plications  in  datasets,  ground  truth  quality  of  datasets,  and  dataset  sources.Then we conduct the experiment designs based on these four dataset factors.Finally,  we  conduct  a  comprehensive  empirical  study  to  assess  the  impact  ofthese factors on the performance of machine learning-based methods.
Results:we conduct this empirical study on 11324 benign and 17055 maliciousapplications, and the experiments show that these four dataset factors can leadto yielding significant biases in the existing machine learning-based methods.
Conclusion:Based on experimental results, we learn some lessons about howto eliminate the impact of dataset factors on machine learning-based methodsin Android malware detection
